It is like a dream when I can study in UK. This dream came a long time ago when the first day after my undergraduate graduation from Universitas Gadjah Mada in 2010. At that time, I just realized that I just got 375 for the TOEFL score. I knew that for studying in abroad Universities, I have to obtain minimum requirement around 550 of TOEFL score.

From that moment, I spent my time to study English in some English Course institutions. I spent around 4 months studying English in Jogja English Dormitory for develop my basic in English. What I got after studying in this institution was an increasing TOEFL score to 450. It was still so far from the target; 550.

I tried to take a course in Pare Kediri which is the most famous place to study English for Indonesia students.
